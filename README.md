# Multi-Layer-Hybrid-CryptoSystem-Combining-RSA-AES-Vigenere-Polybius-ciphers-for-Robust-Data-Security
# Multi-Layer Hybrid Cryptographic System

This is a **Streamlit web application** for encrypting and decrypting text using a multi-layer hybrid cryptographic approach. The system combines **Polybius Cipher**, **Vigenère Cipher**, **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**, and **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** algorithms to provide enhanced security.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Secure your message with multiple layers of encryption.
- **Decryption**: Decode encrypted messages back to plaintext.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for seamless interaction.
- **Hybrid Cryptographic Model**:
  - **Polybius Cipher** for initial encryption.
  - **Vigenère Cipher** for text-based key encryption.
  - **AES** for fast, symmetric encryption.
  - **RSA** for secure key exchange.
