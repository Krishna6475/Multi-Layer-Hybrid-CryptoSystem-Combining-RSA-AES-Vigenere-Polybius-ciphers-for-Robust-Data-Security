# 🔒 Hybrid Cryptographic System

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **multi-layer hybrid encryption system** integrating **AES, RSA, Vigenère, and Polybius ciphers** to ensure **secure and efficient data encryption**. By combining **symmetric and asymmetric encryption**, this system provides robust **data confidentiality, integrity, and security**.

### ✨ Key Features  
✅ **Multi-Layer Encryption** – Uses **AES, RSA, Vigenère, and Polybius ciphers** for enhanced security.  
✅ **Secure Key Exchange** – RSA encryption protects AES keys for secure transmission.  
✅ **Data Integrity Assurance** – Ensures encryption remains uncompromised against attacks.  
✅ **Python-Based Implementation** – Easy-to-use and efficient cryptographic system.

## 🔑 Encryption & Decryption Process  
1️⃣ **Polybius Cipher** – Converts plaintext into numeric grid-based encryption.  
2️⃣ **Vigenère Cipher** – Applies key-based letter shifts for additional security.  
3️⃣ **AES Encryption** – Encrypts data using a symmetric encryption key.  
4️⃣ **RSA Encryption** – Secures the AES key with asymmetric encryption.

## 📈 Use Cases  
🔹 **Secure Data Transmission** – Encrypt messages before sending over a network.  
🔹 **File Encryption** – Protect confidential files using multi-layer encryption.  
🔹 **Authentication Systems** – Implement in secure login mechanisms.
